function [dist1, dist2, error1, error2] = distDictRegression(D1,D2)
% this function gives a quantitative measure of two dictionaries
% the items in both dictionary may not be in the same column and
% thus a direct calculation is not feasible.
% This function uses instead a regression approach, by regressing
% D1 on D2 first to get the regression coefficient matrix. If two
% dictionaries are similar the regression coefficient matrix should
% be close to an identity matrix after a proper permutation of the 
% columns. The closeness to an identity matrix is measured by Amari 
% metric, which is commonly used in ICA.
